Q:What happens when you initialize a repostory? Why do you need to do it?
A:A hidden .git subdirectory is created in the repository root.  This contains
  all the metadata about the repository.

Q:How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
  repository? What value do you think it offers?
A:The staging area is in intermediate state before moving files from the
  working directory to the repository.  It allows you to control which files
  are under version control and to control which files are committed together.

Q:How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
  logical change?
A:By only adding only those files related to a logical change before committing.

Q:What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your 
  history organized? How would branches help?
A:When working on a patch release while continuing to develop new features for
  an upcoming feature release.  Bug fixes could be worked on in the master 
  branch while new features are developed in a specific feature branch.
