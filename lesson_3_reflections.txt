Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
 work local?
A:When you want to colloborate with other authors.  When you want to make your
  code available to others. Or if you want to have an additional backup of 
  your code.

Q:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
  automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository.
A:For the same reasons you would want to control when you commit changes. 
  Changes you pull might not be compatable with your local changes and may
  break your build.  You might want to wait until you've completed a logical 
  unit of work.  Also they might cause merge conflicts.

Q:Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
  use one instead of another.
A:Clones operate on a repository and create a copy of an entire repository, 
  while branches are in a single repository.  Forks are like clones but 
  exist only on GitHubs server.  Forks are used when you want to have a 
  remote but don't want to or don't have rights to commit to the owner's 
  remote. Clones are used to copy remotes locally.  Branches are for when
  you want to isolate a feature or bug fix from the main history.

Q:What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
  stored locally?
A:It allows you to syncronize changes from the remote without having to 
  incorporate them to your local master right away.
