Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
 work local?
A:When you want to colloborate with other authors.  When you want to make your
  code available to others. Or if you want to have an additional backup of 
  your code.

Q:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
  automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository.
A:For the same reasons you would want to control when you commit changes. 
  Changes you pull might not be compatable with your local changes and may
  break your build.  You might want to wait until you've completed a logical 
  unit of work.  Also they might cause merge conflicts.
